Comprehensive Backup and Restore System for Linux Servers

A comprehensive backup and restore system is very important in ensuring data integrity and availability in case of system failures, shutdown or any events that results in loss of data. Having automated backups
and a relaiable restore system helps minimize downtime and ensures system continuity.

This project involves creating scripts that automate the backup and restoration of files, directories, and databases on Linux servers. The system will use shell scripting for automation, cron jobs for scheduling, and Git for version control. Logs will be maintained for all backup and restore operations.
